## Variables
### Expressions, Variables, and Evaluation
An <strong>expression</strong> is a well-formed combination of symbols which possibly contain <strong>variables</strong>

An expression may be evaluated according to some rules, given an assignment of values to the variables

Functions can also be represented as a <strong>function</strong> such as $f(x) = x^2$

The <strong>set</strong> of all considered inputs to the function or variable(s) for which there is a val;id evaluation according to the rules is called the <strong>domain</strong> of the function or variable(s)

A <strong>definition</strong> gives a statement of meaning to a term

A <strong>universal statement</strong> says that a certain property is true for all elements in a set. In other words, a property is true for every element in a set
<ul>
  <li>Every person in this class is a USF student</li>
</ul>

A <strong>conditional statement</strong> says that if one thing is true then some other thing also has to be true. In other words, the <strong>antecedent</strong> is true if the <strong>consequent</strong> is true
<ul>
  <li>If a person is in this class, they are a USF student</li>
</ul>

An <strong>existential statement</strong>says that there is at least one thing for which the property is true. In other words, a property is true for at least one element of a set
<ul>
  <li>Some person in this class is not a USF student</li>
</ul>

A <strong>universal conditional statement</strong> is a statement that is both universal and conditional
<ul>
  <li>For all people a, if a is a rich person, then a is a snob</li>
</ul>  

## The Language of Sets
A <strong>set</strong> is a well-defined collection of distinct objects known as <strong>members</strong> or <strong>elements</strong>

The notation $x \in A$, read as $x$ in $A$, indicates that the element $x$ is a member of the set $A$. The notation $x \notin A$ means that $x$ is not in $A$

The <strong>cardinality</strong> of a set $A$, denoted as $|A|$, is the number of elements contained in the set, where writing $|A| = \infty$ denotes that $A$ contains infinitely many elements

<ul>
  <li>$\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all<strong>real numbers</strong>. Real numbers are all the numbers that can be found on the number line</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{C}$ is the set of all <strong>complex numbers</strong>. Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of all <strong>integers</strong>. Integers are any positive or negative whole numbers</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of all <strong>rational numbers</strong>. A rational number is any real number that is an integer or is a fraction</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of all <strong>natural numbers</strong>. A natural number is any integer greater than zero</li>
</ul>  

### Set-Roster Notation
A set may be specified using <strong>set-roster notation by writing all of its elements between braces. For example, the set $A = {1, 2, 3}$ denotes the set whose elements are 1, 3, and 3

A variation of the notation is sometimes used to describe a very large set, as the set 
$A = {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}$ regers to the set of all integers from 1 to 100. The symbol ... is called an <strong>ellipsis</strong> and is read "and so forth"

Here is an example of using set-roster notation:

$$
X = {1, 2, 3} \quad Y = {1, 3, 2} \quad Z = {1, 2, 2, 3}
$$


### Set-Builder Notation
a convenient way to refer to sets is using capital letters
